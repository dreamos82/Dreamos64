# DreamOS64

DreamOS64 is just my recent attempt to write a kernel again after many years far from osdev, 
But this time in 64bit.

It is not a real replacement of the original DreamOS, and i don't really have any long term plans for it at the moment.

I started this project because i was missing the excitement of low-level programming :) 

## What it does

Actually nothing! :D 

It just prints the OS name and another string. 

What i have implemented so far:

* Long mode 
* Kernel load in higher half
* Basic i/o functions (using the VGA bios)
* Basic framebuffer support (it can print strings on the screen, but only on the first half of the screen, the second half will cause a #PF for now) 
* IDT Support
* It can load the kernel using 4kb pages or 2Mb pages
* Added support to accrss paging data structures with recursion tecnique. 


## Prerequisites: 

These are the packages you need to build and run it: 

* nasm
* qemu and qemu-kvm
* grub-mkrescue
* xorriso
* Gcc cross compiler - Instructions coming soon

## Build
### Building the cross compiler

To build the cross compiler you need the following packages:

* build-essential (on debian derivatives)
* bison
* flex
* libgmp3-dev
* libmpc-dev
* libmpfr-dev
* texinfo
* libcloog 

Then you need to download sources of: 
* Binutils - available here: https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/
* Gcc - Available here: https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/

Decide where to install the tools and declare the environment variables: 

```bash
export PREFIX="$HOME/opt/cross"
export TARGET=x86_64-elf
export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
```

Now create a new folder and enter into it: 

```bash
mkdir build-binutils
cd build-binutils
```

Let's assume that this folder is in the same level of the binutils sources.

Then you can compile the tools using the custom PREFIX and TARGET: 

```bash
../binutils-x.y.z/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix="$PREFIX" --with-sysroot --disable-nls --disable-werror
make
make install
```

* --disable-nls disable national language support, it helps to reduce compile time.
* --with-sysroot Tells binutils to enable sysroot support in the cross-compiler by pointing it to a default empty directory.

If everything goes ok, you can see in your $PREFIX folder the output of the build.
Now is time for gcc, we will use a similar approach. First create a build dir: 
```bash
mkdir build-gcc
cd build-gcc
```

Again i assume that it is on the same level of the gcc sources folder. 
To compile: 

```bash
../gcc-x.y.z/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix="$PREFIX" --disable-nls --enable-languages=c,c++ --without-headers
make all-gcc
make all-target-libgcc
make install-gcc
make install-target-libgcc
```

* --enable-languages=c,c++ we tell gcc to enable only those languages
* --without-headers We tell to ignore all the C libraries present for the target.

Now if you want you can make permanent the $PATH update:

### Build the OS 
To build just run: 

```bash
    make
```

It will create an output file called DreamOs64.iso

## Run

To run just execute: 
```bash
    make run
```

If you use instead:
```bash
   make debug
```

It will output logging information on a logfile.

Finally:
```bash
   make gdb
```
Will compile the OS with debug symbol, and launch qemu with remote debugging enabled (it will wait connection from gdb to start).

There are couple of flags that you can set on the Makefile in order to configure some features: 

* USE_FRAMEBUFFER if set to 1 it will enable framebuffer support (still experimental and probably will not work everywhere since is in very early stage of development), in addition you need a PSF v2 font fle in the folder fonts called deafult.psf, if set to 0 (default) it will use the legacy VGA driver
* SMALL_PAGES if set to 1 it will use 4kb pages (this feature is new, and there are still some problems/unmapped parts that will cause #PF to be generated), if 0 (default) will use 2MB pages. 

### Known issues

Currently the framebuffer output is not working when 4k pages are used (SMALL_PAGES flag set to 1)
